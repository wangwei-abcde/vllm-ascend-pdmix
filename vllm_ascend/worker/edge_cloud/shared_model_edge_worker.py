"""Shared-model edge worker for the edge-cloud collaboration feature.

This module defines :class:`SharedModelEdgeWorker`, a subclass of
:class:`NPUWorker` that lets multiple DP-rank edge workers live in a
single process and share a single ``nn.Module`` replica in NPU memory.

Key invariants:

- All virtual workers in the process share one ``self.rank`` (one
  distributed process group per process).
- ``self.local_rank`` uniquely identifies a virtual worker inside the
  process and is set to be equal to ``self.parallel_config.data_parallel_rank``.
- The total number of virtual workers is
  ``self.parallel_config.data_parallel_size``.
- Only the virtual worker with ``local_rank == 0`` (the *leader*) runs
  the heavy one-shot initialisation (device init, distributed init,
  workspace, model load, NPU graph capture). Followers (the rest) reuse
  the leader's process-level state and bind to the leader's model
  through :meth:`BatchedModelRunner.bind_to_shared_model`.
- All virtual workers participate in PP communication at runtime.
  ``local_rank == k`` routes its PP messages to the cloud first-worker
  for DP-rank ``k``.

PP group layout (with ``data_parallel_size == N``):

    in-group rank 0:        edge_R (the single edge distributed rank)
    in-group rank 1..N:     cloud_dp_0_first, ..., cloud_dp_{N-1}_first

So:

- The edge (one rank) is at in-group rank 0.
- The cloud's first workers are at in-group ranks 1..N. The cloud
  first-worker for DP instance ``k`` is at in-group rank ``k + 1``.

Each virtual edge worker ``k`` communicates with the cloud peer at
in-group rank ``k + 1``. From the cloud's view, the edge is at
in-group rank 0.

This class only implements the *edge* side. The cloud side keeps the
existing edge-cloud layout (one process per cloud rank, TP within each
DP instance, only the first cloud rank per DP instance participating in
the shared PP group).

    the tail recv + tail forward is deferred to the end of the
    current round.

    The class is both an :class:`AsyncModelRunnerOutput` *and*
    a :class:`collections.abc.Callable` — the
    :class:`vllm.v1.executor.shared_model_multiproc_executor.SharedModelWorkerProc`
    detects markers via the conjunction
    ``isinstance(output, AsyncModelRunnerOutput) and callable(output)``
    and accumulates them in ``self._pending_deferred``,
    invoking ``get_output()`` at the round boundary (which
    runs the postprocess and writes the final result to
    ``response_mqs[dp_rank]``).

    Two call surfaces are supported:

    * :meth:`get_output` — the path the WorkerProc takes via
      :meth:`vllm.v1.executor.shared_model_multiproc_executor.SharedModelWorkerProc.enqueue_output`.
      After running the postprocess, it does **one more type
      check** on the result: if the postprocess happens to
      return another :class:`AsyncModelRunnerOutput` (e.g. a
      future from a nested deferred step), it is unwrapped via
      ``result.get_output()`` recursively. The result the
      WorkerProc sees is therefore guaranteed to be a
      ``ModelRunnerOutput`` / ``None`` / ``IntermediateTensors``
      / ``Exception``, never a still-deferred object.

    * :meth:`__call__` — the direct-call path. The postprocess
      is run and the raw result is returned **without any
      type check**. This is what other code (e.g. unit tests
      or hand-rolled drivers) gets when it bypasses the
      WorkerProc's enqueue_output unwrap and simply calls the
      marker.

      ``self``-agnostic.

      per-dp_rank intermediates from the recv closures, run 1× batched
      tail forward + 1× ``compute_logits`` on the leader runner, slice

    :class:`MultiprocExecutor` can drive it through ``collective_rpc``
    without changes.

    KV cache global remap (non-embedding_only)
    ------------------------------------------
    When the edge runs in ``head_tail`` mode (i.e. not ``embedding_only``),
    every dp_rank worker gets a per-dp_rank ``KVCacheConfig`` whose
    ``num_blocks`` reflects only that dp_rank's share of the global
    pool. To allow a single batched forward to address the union of all
    dp_rank KV blocks (one global buffer):

    1. Each worker's ``BatchedModelRunner.initialize_kv_cache`` registers
       its ``KVCacheConfig`` in the class-level
       :attr:`BatchedModelRunner._KV_CACHE_CONFIGS_PER_DP_RANK[dp_rank]`.
    2. The LAST worker to enter ``initialize_kv_cache`` detects
       ``len(...) == data_parallel_size`` and invokes
       :meth:`allocate_global_kv_cache_tensors` once to build a global
       KV buffer of size ``sum(num_blocks_per_dp)``.
    3. The buffer is then shared across all registered workers via a
       shared ``self.kv_caches`` reference, and the forward context is
       bound exactly once (avoids duplicated work).

    The "last caller" is whichever dp_rank worker happens to be the
    final one to register; it does NOT have to be the leader.

    Note: the sync state lives on ``BatchedModelRunner`` (not on
    ``SharedModelEdgeWorker``) because it conceptually belongs to the
    model runner — the worker class doesn't need to know about
    ``KVCacheConfig`` or the construction protocol.
